      <p>
        Central Park, New York City's most loved place, is located between the Upper West and Upper East Sides of Manhattan.
        The park has natural-looking plantings and landforms, having been almost entirely landscaped when built in the 1850s and 1860s. It has eight lakes and ponds that were created artificially by damming natural seeps and flows. There are several wooded sections, lawns, meadows, and grassy areas.
